## [1.27.0] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed
- tariffs: City of Cape Town TOU tariffs (`CoCT LV TOU`, `CoCT MV TOU`, `CoCT HV TOU`, both 2025/26 and 2026/27) now use the CoCT TOU clock (new `coct-2025` schedule) instead of the Eskom clock. From 2025/26 CoCT uses one clock all year, equal to Eskom's Low Demand clock: weekday peak 07-09 and 18-21, standard 06-07, 09-18 and 21-22; Saturday standard 07-12 and 18-20; Sunday standard 18-20. Only the prices change in winter (Jun-Aug). Sources: Electricity Consumptive Tariffs 2025/26 p4 ("Changes for 2025/26!"), Annexure 6 2026/27 p3, and the July 2026 "Understanding Residential Electricity Tariffs" guideline p4. Summer results are unchanged. In winter the Eskom clock wrongly put 06:00-07:00 and 17:00-18:00 in peak and 08:00-09:00 and 20:00-21:00 in standard, and shifted the weekend standard windows an hour early, so CoCT winter savings (especially BESS peak shaving) were misallocated. Rates unchanged. `CoCT Small Power Users 1` is flat and stays on the default schedule.

## [1.26.0] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed
- tariffs: City of Johannesburg 2026/27 rates corrected to the approved City Power schedule ("Schedule of Approved Tariffs for FY26/27", dated 01 July 2026). v1.22.0 loaded a projection (2025/26 x 8.63%, the City's headline electricity figure); the approved LPU rates are 2025/26 x 9.01% on every line, so all 2026/27 CoJ charges were understated by about 0.35%. Energy still carries the 6 c/kWh Network Surcharge. Examples (excl VAT): Industrial TOU LV/MV/HV HD peak 770.09 -> 772.24 c/kWh, LD off-peak 192.22 -> 192.35; TOU LV demand R459.67 -> R461.28/kVA, TOU MV R429.61 -> R431.11; TOU LV fixed R4 613.51 -> R4 629.64/m, TOU MV R12 664.17 -> R12 708.47/m; Large Consumer Demand LV winter/summer 339.14/290.49 -> 339.79/290.96 c/kWh, fixed R3 847.21 -> R3 860.67/m, demand R459.61 -> R461.22; Large Consumer Demand MV 320.27/271.60 -> 320.85/272.01 c/kWh, fixed R11 691.99 -> R11 732.89/m, demand R429.61 -> R431.11.
- tariffs: CoJ 2026/27 export (Business & LPU Embedded Generator, <=1 MW) 97.82 -> 103.26 c/kWh on all five tariffs. It rose 14.67%, not the 8.63% assumed.
- tariffs: all CoJ Industrial TOU tariffs (LV/MV/HV, both 2025/26 and 2026/27) now use the City Power TOU clock (new `coj-2025` schedule) instead of the Eskom clock. City Power uses one clock all year: weekday peak 07-10 and 18-20, standard 06-07, 10-18 and 20-22; Saturday standard 07-12 and 18-20; Sunday standard 17-19. Same clock in the 2025/26 booklet (item 5.4.7) and the 2026/27 schedule (page 8). The Eskom clock put winter 06:00-07:00 and 17:00-18:00 in peak and missed 08:00-10:00, so CoJ TOU savings (especially BESS peak shaving) were misallocated in both years.

### Notes
- The approved schedule's "Industrial LV" and "Industrial MV" are the engine's `CoJ Large Consumer Demand LV/MV` (same structure, every rate equals 2025/26 x 9.01%). City Power renamed them; the established names are kept so downstream lookups stay continuous. "Industrial LV/MV (TOU)" map to `CoJ Industrial TOU LV/MV`.
- `CoJ Industrial TOU HV` is not listed in the 2026/27 schedule. It is set to 2025/26 x 9.01% (fixed R86 763.80/m, demand R400.93/kVA) with the same energy rates as LV/MV, as in 2025/26. Verify against a City Power HV bill or quote.
- Not modelled: reactive energy 46.25 c/kVArh, the 70 kVA minimum demand rule, the 2% Business/LPU surcharge (listed in the 2025/26 booklet, not in the 2026/27 schedule), and public holidays billed as Saturdays.

## [1.25.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added
- tariffs: new Mogale City tariff `Mogale City Industrial Large FlexiTime TOU` (Time-of-Use, >600 kVA industrial), added to both the 2025/26 and 2026/27 version blocks. The engine previously carried Industrial Large only as a Non-TOU (flat) tariff, so TOU-metered Industrial Large customers could not be modelled. 2026/27 values (NERSA-approved, effective 2026-07-01): service R15 721.42/m; HD peak/std/off 1194.72 / 310.65 / 165.92 c/kWh; LD peak/std/off 335.50 / 205.52 / 143.72 c/kWh; demand R146.38/kVA; capacity R51.82/kVA. 2025/26 values: service R14 422.00/m; HD 1095.97 / 285.00 / 152.20; LD 307.77 / 188.53 / 131.84; demand R134.28; capacity R47.54. Both years verified against the official NERSA approval letters (2026/27: Ref NER/D/GT411, approved 22 May 2026; 2025/26: Mogale City 2025/26 approval letter, page 5), and the 2026/27 High-Demand rates confirmed against a customer bill.

### Verified
- tariffs: confirmed all six existing Mogale City 2026/27 tariffs already match the NERSA-approved rates (approved figures equal the 9.01% column of the draft application, which is what was loaded). No rate corrections required. Note: the approved schedule also lists an Industrial Medium (Non-TOU) tariff (263.80 c/kWh) the engine does not carry; left out of scope.

## [1.24.1] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed
- tariffs: revert Mogale City 2026/27 Non-TOU tariff names to their established 2025/26 names so they stay continuous across rate years (downstream lookups are by name). The 2026/27 block had dropped the parentheses, so the engine treated them as separate tariffs and flagged them "not in 2025/26": `Mogale City Commercial Medium Non-TOU` -> `Mogale City Commercial Medium (Non-TOU)`, `Mogale City Commercial Large Non-TOU` -> `Mogale City Commercial Large (Non-TOU)`, `Mogale City Industrial Large Non-TOU` -> `Mogale City Industrial Large (Non-TOU)`. The three FlexiTime TOU names already matched across both years. Rate values unchanged.

## [1.24.0] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed
- tariffs: City of Cape Town 2026/27 energy charges corrected to the approved schedule (Annexure 6, 2026/27 Budget, June 2026). The stored 2026/27 values were a provisional estimate that overstated every energy (c/kWh) rate by exactly 4.04 c/kWh across all four modelled tariffs (SPU1, LV/MV/HV TOU) and all TOU periods. Cause: the estimate assumed an unregulated levy portion of ~41.10 c/kWh; the approved figure dropped it to 37.06 c/kWh. Examples (R excl VAT): LV TOU HD Peak 783.74 -> 779.70, LV TOU off-peak 189.53 -> 185.49, MV TOU HD Peak 759.78 -> 755.74, HV TOU HD Peak 733.51 -> 729.47, SPU1 energy 298.10 -> 294.06. Service, demand, network capacity (NMD) and all SSEG rates already matched the approved schedule and are unchanged. Slightly reduces modelled grid cost, so solar/BESS savings on CoCT cases were marginally overstated before this fix.

## [1.23.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added
- tariffs: Saldanha Bay 2026/27 rates (effective 2026-07-01), on the six established Bulk LV/MV tariffs. In the municipality's 2026/27 schedule the "Bulk LV/MV" names are marked "Deleted" and replaced by "Industrial Consumers" kVA bands (Tariff 3); the published band values are exactly the 2025/26 Bulk figures escalated by the stated 9.26% electricity increase (~9.24% realised). We keep the established Bulk names for continuity (downstream lookups are by name) and map each to the band covering its kVA range: energy 159.39 -> 174.12 c/kWh (R1.7412), demand R488 -> R533/kVA, service R4 895/m (71-500 kVA), R36 816/m (501-630), R46 510/m (501-1000 MV / 631-999 band), R72 030/m (>1000 kVA / 1-5 MVA). Export/SSEG set flat to 114 c/kWh (Tariff 4 Domestic Infeed, R1.14/kWh; was R1.04). Source: Saldanha Bay 2026/27 Rates and tariffs document, section 3, page 5.

## [1.22.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- tariffs: City of Johannesburg 2026/27 rates (effective 2026-07-01). All charges on all 5 CoJ tariffs (Industrial TOU LV/MV/HV, Large Consumer Demand LV/MV) escalated 8.63% off 2025/26: energy, export, service and demand. Verify against the published City Power 2026/27 schedule when available, in particular the export rate (flat 90.05 -> 97.82 c/kWh), which municipalities sometimes escalate at a different rate than consumption charges.

## [1.21.0] - 2026-07-04

### Changed
- tariffs: Stellenbosch 2026/27 TOU periods now follow the Eskom clock (per the municipality's published 2026/27 schedule, identical band-for-band). The 2026-07-01 version block points at the "eskom" TOU schedule; the 2025-07-01 block keeps "stellenbosch-2025" so historical date lookups are unchanged.

### Added
- tariffs: new provider Emfuleni (ELM) with 8 tariffs, both 2025/26 and 2026/27 (proposed, 9.01%) versions: Commercial Prepaid/Conventional (<=100 kVA), Commercial SPU LV 400V (>100 kVA), Commercial SPU MV (<1 MVA), Commercial LPU MV (>1 MVA, <=66 kV), Commercial LPU HV (66-132 kV, >1 MVA), Miniflex TOU (LV, <1 MVA), Megaflex TOU (MV, >1 MVA). Source: ELM NERSA tariff application dated 30 March 2026, effective 2026-07-01. 2026/27 rates are proposed pending NERSA approval. No export/SSEG tariffs published; Megaflex network demand charge mapped to demand, network access charge to capacity (NMD); Nightsave and closed Bulk tariffs not included (seasonal demand structure unsupported).

### Fixed
- tariffs: revert Stellenbosch 2026/27 tariff names to their established names so they stay continuous across rate years (downstream lookups are by name): `Stellenbosch TOU LV (TOU1)` -> `Stellenbosch TOU LV`, `Stellenbosch TOU MV (TOU2)` -> `Stellenbosch TOU MV`, `Stellenbosch IND1` -> `Stellenbosch Large Power LV >80A (IND1)`. Rate values unchanged.
- tests: restores the test suite to green (the renamed names had broken the tariff-name and TOU-schedule assertions).

## [1.20.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- tariffs: Hessequa 2026/27 rates (Bulk 71-500 kVA, Bulk >500 kVA, from BVM schedule, effective 2026-07-01)

## [1.19.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- tariffs: Stellenbosch 2026/27 rates (TOU LV/MV, IND1, draft schedule, effective 2026-07-01)

## [1.18.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- tariffs: Overstrand 2026/27 rates (TOU LV E5B, TOU MV E5A, effective 2026-07-01)

## [1.17.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- tariffs: Mogale City 2026/27 rates (9.01% increase, TOU + Non-TOU commercial/industrial, effective 2026-07-01)

## [1.16.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- tariffs: Mangaung 2026/27 rates (Elecflex 1/2/3, effective 2026-07-01)

## [1.15.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- tariffs: Langeberg 2026/27 rates (Bulk LT/HT, Commercial 3-phase, TOU LT/HT, effective 2026-07-01)

## [1.14.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- tariffs: eThekwini 2026/27 rates (Business Scale 1, Industrial TOU, effective 2026-07-01)

## [1.13.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- tariffs: Drakenstein 2026/27 rates (Large Bulk, Bulk TOU MV/LV, effective 2026-07-01)

## [1.12.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **City of Cape Town 2026/27 tariff rates (draft budget, effective 2026-07-01).**
  Updated all four existing CoCT tariffs with 2026/27 rates from the City of Cape
  Town Draft Budget Annexure 6 (March 2026). Source is draft; confirm against the
  final approved budget before the July go-live.
  - CoCT Small Power Users 1: energy 298.10 c/kWh (+6.5%), service R4 204.18/month (+8.6%).
    SSEG Tariff 1: 96.18, Tariff 1+Incentive: 121.18, Tariff 2: 68.46 c/kWh.
  - CoCT LV TOU: HD Peak 783.74, HD Std 248.96, HD OP 189.53, LD Peak 366.62,
    LD Std 237.06, LD OP 189.53 c/kWh. Service R2 519.88/month, NMD capacity
    R39.00/kVA/month, demand R254.76/kVA/month. SSEG TOU HD P/S/O: 625.73/135.65/91.18,
    LD P/S/O: 243.47/124.74/81.18 c/kWh.
  - CoCT MV TOU: HD Peak 759.78, HD Std 242.26, HD OP 184.74, LD Peak 356.12,
    LD Std 230.74, LD OP 184.74 c/kWh. Service R2 610.22/month, NMD capacity
    R19.15/kVA/month, demand R82.38/kVA/month.
  - CoCT HV TOU: HD Peak 733.51, HD Std 234.90, HD OP 179.49, LD Peak 344.60,
    LD Std 223.80, LD OP 179.49 c/kWh. Service R2 610.22/month, NMD capacity
    R18.28/kVA/month, demand R78.67/kVA/month.
  All SSEG flat rates (Tariff 1/1+Incentive/2) and TOU rates are identical across
  LV, MV, and HV TOU tariffs.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Eskom 2025/26 Gen-Offset (export) rates for Miniflex and Ruraflex.**
  Previously only 2026/27 carried Eskom export rates; the 2025/26 booklet does
  publish them (Gen-offset Urban/Rural, Non-local Authority, p45). Added
  `export_energy_c_per_kwh` + `confirmed_base_export_c_per_kwh` for both tariffs
  across all zones/voltages (ex VAT). Default cell >900km <500V, HD Peak:
  Miniflex 671.06 c/kWh, Ruraflex 677.66 c/kWh. Modelled exactly like the
  2026/27 blocks (all-in export = published gen-offset energy charge; ancillary
  credit omitted, as in 2026/27).
- **Eskom 2025/26 Gen-Offset admin fee block** (`admin_fees`, p42) so
  `get_eskom_admin_fee(...)` returns the correct R/POD/day for 2025/26 instead
  of 0: urban 0.73/12.40/19.37/19.37, rural 1.35/12.40/19.37/19.37 by NMD tier.
  The service + admin charge tiers (`service_charge_tiers`) already matched the
  gen-offset values and are unchanged.

  Script: `scripts/add_eskom_2025_export.py`.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-06-18

### Changed
- **Docs:** documented the v1.10.0 NMD service/admin API in README.md and
  DASHBOARD_INTEGRATION.md (`get_tariff_rates(..., nmd_kva=, key_customer=)`,
  `TariffRates.admin_charge_pa`, and the municipality-safe behaviour). No code
  or data change.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Eskom service + administration charges by NMD bracket (Miniflex and
  Ruraflex, both rate years).** Previously `service_charge_pa` was hard-coded to
  the smallest (<=100 kVA) customer category and the admin charge was not
  represented at all. The data now carries a `service_charge_tiers` block per
  Eskom flex tariff (NMD brackets <=100 / <=500 / <=1000 / >1000 kVA plus a
  Key-customer category, each with service and admin R/POD/day, ex VAT). The
  resolver selects the bracket the same way it selects zone/voltage:
  `get_tariff_rates(...)` and `get_tariff_rates_for_date(...)` take an optional
  `nmd_kva` (and `key_customer`) and return the bracket's `service_charge_pa`
  plus a new `admin_charge_pa` field on `TariffRates`.
- **`TariffRates.admin_charge_pa`** (R/year). 0 for tariffs without an admin
  charge.

### Changed / compatibility
- `service_charge_pa` is **kept**. With no `nmd_kva` it returns the smallest
  bracket (<=100 kVA) for Eskom, identical to before, so existing callers are
  unaffected. Municipal tariffs ignore `nmd_kva` entirely and keep their flat
  `service_charge_pa` with `admin_charge_pa` = 0. Example: Ruraflex 2026/27 at
  NMD 1000 kVA now resolves service R78,807.15/yr + admin R7,690.55/yr, vs the
  flat R9,190.70/yr before. Script: `scripts/add_eskom_service_tiers.py`.

### Known gaps
- Megaflex service/admin brackets are **not** included here (folded into the
  Megaflex follow-up; Megaflex has only >1MVA + Key-customer categories and its
  saved service charge is currently wrong).

## [1.9.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Split capacity charge into separate generation and network components
  (Eskom Miniflex and Ruraflex, both rate years).** `TariffRates` now exposes
  `generation_capacity_charge_kva` and `network_capacity_charge_kva` (R/kVA/month)
  alongside the existing combined `capacity_charge_kva`, which is unchanged and
  still equals generation + network. In the data, `generation_capacity_r_kva_month`
  and `network_capacity_r_kva_month` are added next to `capacity_r_kva_month`.
  The generation capacity charge is constant per voltage (Miniflex: 3.49/8.09/6.12/7.02
  in 2025/26, 5.29/12.27/9.28/10.65 in 2026/27; Ruraflex: 3.34/5.03 then 5.07/7.63),
  verified against the Eskom booklets and the 1 April 2026 schedule. Backward
  compatible: tariffs without a split (all others, including municipal) report
  generation = 0 and network = the full capacity charge. Script:
  `scripts/split_eskom_capacity.py`.

### Known gaps
- **Eskom Megaflex 2026/27 is not yet split and is under-modelled.** Its saved
  capacity (42.66 R/kVA/month, <500V) is only the distribution network capacity
  charge; the generation capacity (5.29), transmission network (~11.92) and a
  distribution network demand charge (52.65 R/kVA/month on peak demand) are not
  yet captured. To be addressed in a separate change.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- **City of Johannesburg (City Power) Large Consumer "Demand" tariffs, LV and
  MV (2025/26).** Three-part flat tariff for large consumers: service + network
  fixed charge, monthly demand charge (R/kVA), and a flat seasonal energy charge
  (no time-of-use). Source: CoJ Schedule of Tariffs July 2025 - June 2026,
  section 4 (Large Consumers), "Large Customer Demand" segment, ex VAT. Only LV
  and MV exist for this flat tariff (the HV band is TOU only), matching the
  official schedule.
  - `CoJ Large Consumer Demand LV`: energy 312.20 c/kWh winter / 267.41 c/kWh
    summer, demand 423.10 R/kVA/month, fixed 3541.57 R/month.
  - `CoJ Large Consumer Demand MV`: energy 294.83 c/kWh winter / 250.02 c/kWh
    summer, demand 395.48 R/kVA/month, fixed 10763.13 R/month.
  - Conventions match the existing CoJ Industrial TOU entries: service + network
    summed into `service_r_month`; energy carries the +6 c/kWh Network Surcharge
    that the booklet lists separately; season split follows the default schedule
    (winter Jun-Aug, summer Sep-May). Export = 90.05 c/kWh (Business and Large
    Power User embedded generator energy charge), applied flat.
  - Script: `scripts/add_coj_large_consumer_2025.py`.

### Fixed
- **City of Johannesburg Industrial TOU export rate (2025/26): 89.79 -> 90.05
  c/kWh** on all three bands (LV, MV, HV). The stored value was the prior-year
  embedded generator rate; the 2025/26 schedule (ITEM_03C_ANNEXURE.pdf, page 24)
  lists the Business and Large Power User Embedded Generator Energy Charge as
  90.05 c/kWh. Applied flat across both seasons and all TOU periods (18 cells).

## [1.7.2] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- **Eskom Miniflex and Ruraflex 2026/27 capacity charge (data fix, raises the
  R/kVA/month NMD charge).** `capacity_r_kva_month` was stored as the network
  capacity charge only, dropping the generation capacity charge. Verified
  against the official Eskom 1 April 2026 schedule, which lists both as separate
  R/kVA/month charges; the 2025/26 blocks already bundle generation + network.
  Capacity is now generation + network on all 24 cells (both tariffs, all zones
  and voltages). Effect by voltage: Ruraflex +5.07 (<500V) / +7.63 (≥500V&≤22kV);
  Miniflex +5.29 (<500V) / +12.27 (≥500V<66kV) / +9.28 (≥66kV≤132kV) / +10.65
  (>132kV). Example, >900km <500V: Ruraflex 56.95 -> 62.02, Miniflex
  54.58 -> 59.87 R/kVA/month. Energy, levies and service charges were already
  correct and are unchanged. Script: `scripts/fix_eskom_2026_gen_capacity.py`.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- **Eskom Miniflex and Ruraflex 2025/26 active energy charge (data fix, raises
  all-in import rates).** The 2025/26 `energy_c_per_kwh` values were stored as
  the booklet "Active energy charge" MINUS all per-kWh levies, so the engine
  (which re-adds legacy + ancillary + network demand + electrification +
  affordability) only reproduced the active energy charge and never added the
  levies on top. Energy values are now set to the booklet active energy charge,
  so all-in = active energy + levies, matching the 2025/26 PDFs and the 2026/27
  blocks. Effect: +71.73 c/kWh (Ruraflex <500V) and +62.52/+32.82 c/kWh
  (Miniflex <500V peak-standard / off-peak) on the all-in import rate; smaller
  uplifts on higher-voltage bands. Example, >900km <500V HD Peak: Ruraflex
  711.73 -> 783.46 c/kWh, Miniflex 705.13 -> 767.65 c/kWh. 144 energy cells
  updated across all zones and voltages. Levies, capacity charges, service
  charges and 2026/27 rates are unchanged. Script:
  `scripts/fix_eskom_2025_energy_levies.py`.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Ephraim Mogale Church/Schools/Charitable Single 80A** (2025/26, ex VAT):
  flat energy 253.47 c/kWh, basic R377.68/month, export = Energy Feedback
  172.00 c/kWh (matching the other Ephraim Mogale tariffs). Total count 103 -> 104.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- **Eskom Businessrate 2 and 3** (three-phase, non-local authority) for both
  rate years 2025/26 (2025-04-01) and 2026/27 (2026-04-01). Flat tariff;
  all-in energy = energy + ancillary + network demand + electrification (244.82
  c/kWh in 2025/26, 264.53 in 2026/27). R/POD/day fixed charges annualised x365
  into service_charge_pa. No export. Total tariff count 101 -> 103.
- **City of Ekurhuleni 2026/27** version block (effective 2026-07-01), all 12
  tariffs. **Provisional** (draft schedule v.2026.03.11, pending Council
  approval). +9.01% on all charges except Tariff J and every export credit,
  which rise +8.76% (Eskom Municflex-linked).
- **City of Tshwane 2026/27** version block (effective 2026-07-01), all 6
  tariffs. **Provisional**: uniform +8.8% on every rate and charge.

### Fixed
- **Eskom TOU schedule weekend correction (behavioural — affects all
  Eskom-clock tariffs).** The summer (Low Demand) Saturday/Sunday Standard
  window was corrected from 17:00-19:00 to **18:00-20:00**; winter (High Demand)
  remains 17:00-19:00. This changes Standard vs Off-Peak classification for two
  summer-weekend hours and therefore TOU savings results for every tariff using
  the `eskom` schedule (Eskom + most municipalities). CoE TOU tariffs use the
  corrected `eskom` clock (no separate CoE schedule needed).

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Per-tariff TOU schedules.** TOU clocks (Peak/Standard/Off-Peak hours and
  High/Low season months) are now data-driven named entries in
  `tou.TOU_SCHEDULES`. A tariff selects one via the `tou_schedule` key in
  `tariff_data.json` (absent = `"eskom"`). New public helper
  `list_tou_schedules()`; `get_tou_period()` and `build_hourly_tou()` gain an
  optional `schedule` argument defaulting to `"eskom"`; `TariffRates` gains a
  `tou_schedule` field.
- **`stellenbosch-2025` TOU schedule** (Stellenbosch Municipality 2025/26 clock:
  Winter Jun-Aug, Summer Sep-May, Sunday off-peak all day). Applied to
  `Stellenbosch TOU LV`, `Stellenbosch TOU MV`, and the new IND1 tariff.
  Schedules are year-scoped so a future revision is added as a new entry without
  breaking historical lookups.
- **Stellenbosch Large Power LV >80A (IND1)** tariff (2025/26, ex VAT): flat
  import 180.34 c/kWh, TOU export (HD 616.20/186.69/101.38, LD
  201.00/138.31/87.75), service R3 527.55/month, NMD capacity R82.52/kVA, max
  demand R458.28/kVA.

### Consumer action required
- **Solar Dashboard:** none. `calculate_hourly_savings()` reads
  `tariff_rates.tou_schedule` automatically.
- **Solar Model:** pass the schedule when building the hourly TOU array:
  `build_hourly_tou(year, schedule=rates.tou_schedule)`. Otherwise non-Eskom
  TOU tariffs are classified on the Eskom clock.

### Changed
- Eskom TOU schedule refactored into the registry; behaviour is byte-identical
  (verified across all hour/day/season combinations). Total tariff count now 101.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Eskom Landrate 2** and **Eskom Landrate 3** (three-phase, non-local
  authority) for both rate years: 2025/26 (effective 2025-04-01) and 2026/27
  (effective 2026-04-01). Source: Eskom Schedule of Standard Prices, all ex VAT.
  - Flat (non-TOU) tariff at supply voltage < 500 V; all-in energy rate (active +
    ancillary + network demand) = 287.00 c/kWh (2025/26), 310.41 c/kWh (2026/27),
    identical for Landrate 2 and 3.
  - Fixed R/POD/day charges (network capacity + service & administration +
    generation capacity) summed and annualised x365 into `service_charge_pa`:
    L2 R46 303.90 / L3 R69 466.80 (2025/26); L2 R51 205.85 / L3 R77 201.15 (2026/27).
  - No export tariff (grid-tied generation mandates a TOU tariff), so no export
    rates are returned. Three-phase NMD: L2 = 50 kVA, L3 = 100 kVA.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Ephraim Mogale Local Municipality** 2025/26 provider with 8 tariffs (NERSA
  approval letter Ref NER/D/CBL4, effective 1 July 2025 - 30 June 2026, all ex
  VAT, flat energy, export = Energy Feedback 172.00 c/kWh):
  - Commercial/Industrial Conventional Three Phase 80A and 150A
  - Bulk Commercial 150A and Industrial Bulk 150A (with demand charges)
  - Agriculture Three Phase 80A, 150A, and Bulk (Bulk with demand charge)
  - Church/Schools/Charitable Three Phase 80A

### Changed
- Total tariff count now 98 (doc reference in DASHBOARD_INTEGRATION.md updated).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-29

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- Initial release, extracted from the Solar Model: tariff data, TOU logic,
  rates/savings/history modules.
