TOU period codes: 1 = Peak, 2 = Standard, 3 = Off-Peak.
Seasons: "HI" = High Demand, "LO" = Low Demand.

TOU schedules
-------------
A schedule defines (a) which months are High Demand, and (b) which clock hours
are Peak/Standard/Off-Peak for weekday/Saturday/Sunday in each season. Different
utilities use different schedules: Eskom is the default; municipalities such as
Stellenbosch publish their own. Schedules are data-driven entries in
TOU_SCHEDULES, so adding a utility's schedule is a data edit, not new code.

Each schedule is shaped:

    {
      "hd_months": [6, 7, 8],
      "weekday":  {"HI": {"peak": [[h0, h1], ...], "standard": [[h0, h1], ...]},
                   "LO": {...}},
      "saturday": {"HI": {...}, "LO": {...}},
      "sunday":   {"HI": {...}, "LO": {...}},
    }

Hour ranges are half-open [start, end) in 0-23 clock hours. An hour is Peak (1)
if it falls in any "peak" range, else Standard (2) if in any "standard" range,
else Off-Peak (3). A tariff selects its schedule via the "tou_schedule" key in
tariff_data.json (default "eskom"); TariffRates carries it through to savings.
