## What's in here

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tariff_engine/` | The Python package (importable as `tariff_engine`) |
| `tariff_engine/tariff_data.json` | Master rates file (Eskom + all municipalities, all schema versions) |
| `tariff_engine/tou.py` | TOU schedule classification (Peak/Standard/Off-Peak, HD/LD seasons); named `TOU_SCHEDULES` registry (Eskom default + municipal clocks) |
| `tariff_engine/rates.py` | `TariffRates` dataclass, rate lookup, JSON loading |
| `tariff_engine/history.py` | Historical date-aware rate lookup (`get_tariff_rates_for_date`) |
| `tariff_engine/savings.py` | Hourly savings calculation helpers |
| `scripts/` | Tariff data update + migration helpers |
| `tests/` | Standalone test suite |

## Public API

```python
from tariff_engine import (
    get_tariff_rates,           # latest rates by tariff name (see nmd_kva below)
    get_tariff_rates_for_date,  # rates active on a given date
    get_tou_period,             # classify (month, hour, weekday) into Peak/Std/Off
    build_hourly_tou,           # 8760-hour TOU array for a year
    list_tou_schedules,         # names of available TOU schedules
    calculate_hourly_savings,   # PV/BESS savings per hour
    list_tariffs,               # all available tariff display names
    TariffRates,                # dataclass (carries .tou_schedule, .admin_charge_pa)
)
```

Full signatures:

```python
get_tariff_rates(
    tariff_name, zone=None, voltage=None, sseg_option=None,
    nmd_kva=None,          # customer NMD (kVA): selects the Eskom service+admin bracket
    key_customer=False,    # Eskom "Key Customer" category override
) -> TariffRates

get_tariff_rates_for_date(tariff_name, date, zone=None, voltage=None,
                          nmd_kva=None, key_customer=False) -> TariffRates
```

## TOU schedules (per-tariff)

A TOU **schedule** defines which months are High/Low Demand and which clock
hours are Peak/Standard/Off-Peak. Different utilities use different schedules
(Eskom is the default; some municipalities, e.g. Stellenbosch, publish their
own). Schedules are data-driven entries in `tou.TOU_SCHEDULES`, and each tariff
names its schedule via the `tou_schedule` key in `tariff_data.json` (absent =
`"eskom"`). `TariffRates.tou_schedule` carries that name to consumers.

`get_tou_period(...)` and `build_hourly_tou(...)` take a `schedule` argument that
**defaults to `"eskom"`**, so existing calls keep working unchanged.

**What each consumer must do:**

| Consumer | Required change |
|----------|-----------------|
| Solar Dashboard | **None.** `calculate_hourly_savings()` reads `tariff_rates.tou_schedule` and applies the correct schedule automatically. |
| Solar Model | When building the hourly TOU array, pass the tariff's schedule: `build_hourly_tou(year, schedule=rates.tou_schedule)` instead of `build_hourly_tou(year)`. Without this, non-Eskom tariffs (e.g. Stellenbosch TOU) are classified on the Eskom clock. |

Schedules are **year-scoped when a utility revises its clock** (e.g.
`stellenbosch-2025`). Never edit an existing schedule entry; add a new one and
point the new rate-year's version block at it, so historical date lookups stay
accurate.

## Service + admin charges by NMD bracket (Eskom, added v1.10.0)

Eskom Miniflex and Ruraflex charge the **service** and **administration**
charges (R/POD/day) by customer category, which is set by the customer's
Notified Maximum Demand (NMD). The engine stores these brackets per tariff in
`tariff_data.json` (`service_charge_tiers`) and selects the right one when you
pass `nmd_kva`:

```python
t = get_tariff_rates("Eskom Ruraflex", nmd_kva=1000)
t.service_charge_pa   # R78,807.15  (the >500 kVA-1 MVA band, not the ≤100 kVA default)
t.admin_charge_pa     # R7,690.55   (admin charge for that band; was previously not modelled)
```

- `TariffRates.service_charge_pa` reflects the NMD bracket when `nmd_kva` is
  given; without it, it defaults to the smallest (≤100 kVA) bracket so existing
  callers are unchanged.
- `TariffRates.admin_charge_pa` is the matching administration charge (R/year).
  Add it to `service_charge_pa` for the full fixed service cost.
- `key_customer=True` selects the Eskom "Key Customer" category.

**What each consumer must do:**

| Consumer | Required change |
|----------|-----------------|
| Solar Model | Pass `nmd_kva=inputs.nmd_kva` to `get_tariff_rates(...)` and add `admin_charge_pa` to the fixed-charge total. Without `nmd_kva`, service is the ≤100 kVA value and admin is omitted. |
| Solar Dashboard | Pass `nmd_kva` when resolving rates if you bill the service/admin charge. |

**Municipalities are unaffected.** They have no NMD service brackets; `nmd_kva`
is ignored for non-Eskom tariffs, `service_charge_pa` stays flat, and
`admin_charge_pa` is 0.

## Local development

```bash
# Editable install into your active venv
pip install -e .

# Run tests
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

## Updating tariffs / releasing

**Read [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md) before cutting a release.** It is the
canonical procedure and exists to prevent version/tag drift.

Key rules:

- `pyproject.toml` `version` is the **single source of truth**. The git tag is
  always `v{that version}`; egg-info and `dist/` are derived build output.
- **Never release from a stale checkout.** Always `git fetch origin --tags &&
  git merge --ff-only origin/main` first.
- Run the pre-flight check before tagging. It fails if the branch is behind
  origin, the tag already exists, or the version is malformed:
  ```bash
  py scripts/check_release.py
  ```

Short version:

1. Sync: `git fetch origin --tags && git merge --ff-only origin/main`
2. Edit `tariff_engine/tariff_data.json` (directly or via a `scripts/update_*.py` helper).
3. Bump `version` in `pyproject.toml` (PATCH = data on existing tariffs, MINOR = new tariffs, MAJOR = schema break).
4. `py scripts/check_release.py` (must print OK), then `py -m pytest -q`, then `py -m build`.
5. Commit, then `git tag -a v<version> ...`, then `git push origin main && git push origin v<version>`.
6. Bump the pinned version in each consumer repo (Solar Model, Dashboard) `requirements.txt`.

## Schema versioning

- **schema_version 1**: flat structure, single live version per tariff.
- **schema_version 2** (current): each provider/tariff wraps versions in a `versions` list with `effective` dates, supporting historical lookups.
- Optional per-tariff `other_charges`: a list of `{label, value, unit, note?}` for published charges the engine does not price (reactive energy, energy blocks, per-Amp capacity). Display only; the engine ignores it.

Migration script: `scripts/migrate_tariff_v2.py` (one-off, already applied).

## Tariff calendar

| Provider | Rate-change anniversary |
|----------|------------------------|
| Eskom    | 1 April (1 Apr - 31 Mar) |
| Municipalities | 1 July (1 Jul - 30 Jun) |
